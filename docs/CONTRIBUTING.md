# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! The project is small and contributions are welcome.

How to contribute:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make minimal, focused changes with clear commit messages.
3. Prefer small pull requests that make one change at a time.

Developer workflow:

- No build system is required. Edit files in your editor and open the HTML to test changes in a browser.
- If you add new JavaScript files, keep functions modular and avoid creating global variables where possible.

Areas where help is useful:

- Add automated tests or examples (a small test harness could be added with Node or Pytest).
- Replace the naive evaluation approach with a safer expression parser.
- Improve accessibility of UI controls and add unit tests for math helpers.

Style guidelines:

- Follow the existing code style: concise functions and clear variable names.
- Add comments only when the intent is non-obvious.
